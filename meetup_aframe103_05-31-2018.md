## Todays Workshop Project: Demo 10 A-Frame Propelify AR (AR.js)
![inline,fit](images/AFrameDemo10.jpg) 

---

## We will be covering:

* Overview of the current web-based AR landscape
* A-Frame AR (marker-based AR with AR.js)
* Setup: Dev Environment & Git or Glitch
* AR "Hello World"
* QRCode and custom marker
* Building the Propelify Demo

# Overview of the current web-based AR landscape

## Depth Sensors vs Computer Vision (+ DL)

## Depth sensors

![inline,fit](images/kinect.jpg) ![inline,fit](images/depthcamera.jpg) 

Tango, Kinect, [Leap Motion](http://blog.leapmotion.com/hardware-to-software-how-does-the-leap-motion-controller-work/), or Asus Xtion
IR (Infrared) or Laser point cloud

---

## [Computer Vision](http://safecarnews.com/mapillary-secures-15m-series-b-to-accelerate-global-map-data-collection/) & [Deep Learning](https://www.slideshare.net/AugmentedWorldExpo/gary-brown-movidius-intel-deep-learning-in-ar-the-3-year-horizon)

![inline,fit](images/cvdl.gif) ![inline,fit](images/facerec.jpg) 

OpenCV (open-source C++ Library from Intel)

* tracking.js
* three.ar.js / jsartoolkit

## WebARonTango [shut down to focus on ARCore](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-shutting-down-project-tango-in-march-2018/)

![right](images/tango.png) 

Tango (launched in 2014) and Chromium (extending the WebVR 1.1 API)
Needed a Tango enabled device

* Wide FOV Camera & Infrared Camera
* Features: Marker detection, ADF support (Tango saves these area scans in an Area Description File), motion tracking, rendering of the camera's video feed, and basic understanding of the real world
 
---

## WebARonARCore/WebARonARKit

![inline](images/arkit1.gif) ![inline](images/arcore1.gif) ![inline](images/arkit2.gif) ![inline](images/arcore2.gif) 

* Install custom app/browser to access device hardware for exposure to browser
* Limited to devices that support ARCore/ARKit (provide marker detection capabilities, plane detection and hit testing)

---

## THREE.AR - WebVR API extension for smartphone AR

* Motion tracking - exact location and orientation in 3D space (6DOF)
* Rendering the pass through camera (rendering on top of camera feed)
* Basic understanding of the real world - identify planes in the real world (or meshes, objects/markers, point clouds)

---

## AR.js (& A-Frame)

![right](images/arjs.png)

* **Fast** - up to 60 fps on two year-old devices 
* **Web-based** - no installation, javascript based on three.js + jsartoolkit5 
* **Open Source** - large community 
* **Using Web Standards** - WebGL and WebRTC (no additional hardware needed)

---

## Anchors 
 
* Estimation of the pose of the device in the real world with the highest accuracy possible. 
* Evolves over time as the system "learns" more about the real world - value is updating.
* Notifying the application about changes in the tracking estimation so the virtual element can correct its pose.

---

## Markers

* Printed tags that the AR system can recognize when they are in the line of sight of the camera so their world scale pose can be calculated. 
* Useful to trigger an experience or to share the same coordinate system between different devices, among others.
* Two types of markers: QRCodes and ARMarkers. Both allow to obtain their world pose but in the case of QRCodes, they can contain a string that is encoded in the marker itself. ARMakers have a unique identifier, a number between 0 and 255.
