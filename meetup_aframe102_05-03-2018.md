## We will be covering:

* Recap: Development Environment Setup with Gulp and Browsersync
* A deeper look into geometry and materials for primitives
* a-mixins
* a-obj-model / OBJ files (Google Poly Library)
* Writing a launchpad component
* Physics Component (based on CANNON.js @donmccurdy)

## First a look at some data!

* [What's the mass of bowling ball? (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_ball) 
The USBC and FIQ specifies that ... The weight of the ball must not exceed 16.00 pounds (7.26 kg), ...

[Physics System Component](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system)

* dynamic-body and static-body, shape, mass ...
* debug, system, gravity
